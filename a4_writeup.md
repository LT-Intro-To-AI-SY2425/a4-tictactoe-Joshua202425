# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    Creating the function to see if anyone won.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    When someone inputs their move I would have the computer input its move based on the person's move so the computer would always win or make it a draw.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    I would have the computer always go first and put an "X" in a corner and if the person doesn't put an "O" in the middle then its a guranteed win, but if they do put an "O" in the middle then I would have the computer put its move in the opposite corner to ensure at least a draw or a win for the computer.
